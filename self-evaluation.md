# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful? It's useful to list all the data and be able to do the same task on all of them.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? I need to practice the other practice examples in this such as "finding the square root of each number". 
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? It all went well because I made an example layout on how this each/do method goes and I was able to use that to setup for the challenge problem.
